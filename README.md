# Categories of Patterns

The Gang of Fourâ€™s pattern catalog contains 23 patterns. These patterns are categorized into three main types: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. Some patterns may span multiple categories, but these classifications help organize and characterize the patterns.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on the creation or cloning of objects. They depend on the programming language used. For instance, languages without classes, like JavaScript, use prototypes to clone and expand objects at runtime. In contrast, languages like Java and C# instantiate objects using predefined classes.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns describe how objects connect and interact. They relate to decomposition and generalization principles. These patterns define relationships between objects, subclasses, and classes, determining how they should work to achieve design goals. A metaphor for structural patterns is pairing foods based on flavor, like chickpeas and garlic in hummus.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on work distribution among objects, ensuring each performs a cohesive function. They emphasize collaboration towards a common goal, akin to a racing car pit crew where each member has a role but works together to achieve success.
